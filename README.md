# EDA---Global-Terrorism-Dataset

Introduction:

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an extensive dataset providing information on terrorist incidents worldwide. This readme file aims to provide an overview of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the GTD.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset contains detailed information about terrorist attacks, including location, date, attack type, target, and casualties.
It covers incidents from 1970 to [Latest Year], sourced from various channels such as news reports, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organizations.
Each record in the dataset represents a single terrorist incident.
Purpose of EDA:
The primary objectives of conducting EDA on the Global Terrorism Dataset are:

To gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist incidents worldwide.
To identify regions, countries, and groups most affected by terrorism.
To analyze the impact of terrorism on different target types, such as civilians, military, and government.
Methodology:
The EDA process involves the following steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Loading the dataset into a suitable environment (e.g., Python, R) and performing necessary data cleaning operations such as handling missing values, data type conversions, and removing duplicates.
Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset through statistical summaries, visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar plots, heatmaps), and geographical analysis (e.g., plotting incidents on maps).
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to extract more meaningful insights from the data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests to validate hypotheses and identify significant relationships between variables.
Interpretation and Conclusion: Drawing conclusions from the analysis and providing insights into the nature and dynamics of global terrorism.
Contents of the Repository:

Data Folder: Contains the Global Terrorism Dataset in CSV format.
Notebook Folder: Contains Jupyter Notebooks documenting the EDA process, including code, visualizations, and interpretations.
Visualization Folder: Contains images of key visualizations generated during the analysis.
Readme File: Provides an overview of the EDA process and contents of the repository.
Conclusion:
The EDA on the Global Terrorism Dataset aims to shed light on the complex phenomenon of terrorism and its impact on societies worldwide. By analyzing patterns and trends in terrorist incidents, we can better understand the factors contributing to terrorism and inform strategies for prevention and mitigation.
